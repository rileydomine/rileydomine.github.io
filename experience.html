            <h3>Co-Founder of Boys4Bikes Non-Profit (2013 - Present)</h3>
            <p>I co-founded a nonprofit charity group in 2014 called Boys4Bikes. In the past 10 years, we have raised over $55,000 and have donated over 600 bikes to victims of California wildfires and youth in need right before Christmas. In the Spring of 2023, our registered nonprofit was granted a State Senate Recognition from Senator Angelique Ashby. As a co-founder, a lot of my work revolved on overseeing others on their tasks. Many examples of my leadership in Boys4Bikes include managing social media platforms such as the Instagram account and website, and overseeing the funds and finances of each operation. Last year in particular, I guided the entire group on the logistics on what we could do better to make more profits as well as introduced many possible sponsors which turned out to be a success.

            <h3>CREATE Mentoring Program - Construction Industry Education Foundation (2021 - 2024)</h3>
            <p>I participated for three years in CREATE, a competitive design and architecture apprenticeship mentored by architects, designers, and engineers. I competed with a team on projects, like fabricating a homeless shelter out of shipping containers, or developing a new building on my school campus. The program involved utilizing local zoning codes, legalities, and engineering designs to create a final rendered and government approved design. Throughout the years, I worked on various 3D design and render teams and was a leader in the video editing and physical mock-up teams. In 2021 I won the Best Presentation award.

            <p>As a member of MESA, I participated in many projects; most notably, bridge design and sustainability, where I designed and built a popsicle stick bridge based around a double intersection warren style. My bridge held 208 lbs and won 3rd place at a regional competition at UC Davis; as well as a MESA Machine Project, designing and constructing Rube Goldberg machines which had to utilize different physics concepts to complete the end goal of moving a car a specific distance from the machine. My team’s unique approach led to our qualification for the Statewide MESA competition in East Bay, CA.
